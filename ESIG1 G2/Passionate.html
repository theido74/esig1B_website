<h1>Passionate</h1>
<h2>We are old fashionned</h2>
<p>
    We're a bunch of students who are a bit "old school" when it comes to coding and tech, and we absolutely love it! Picture us in our geeky t-shirts, coffee in hand, diving into programming languages that have stood the test of time. We grew up with classic methods that taught us to appreciate code in all its forms. For us, every line of code is like an adventure, and we're all about mixing those tried-and-true techniques with the latest tech trends. We're buzzing to share our ideas, have a laugh together, and create projects that really stand out, all while giving a nod to those who paved the way before us. Ready to code with us?
